# Microsoft Teams Clone- Meet and Greet

This is a meeting web application which is built under Microsoft Engage Mentorship Program. The challenge was to build a MS teams clone and solution should be a fully functional prototype with at least one mandatory functionality - a minimum of two participants should be able connect with each other using the product to have a video conversation.


My solution has following functionalities where participants can:
* an interact with each other on a video call
* can mute/unmute themselves
* can switch on/off their camera
* can share meeting id or link with others to join
* can join meeting via link/code or start instant meeting
* can have a chat in meeting
* can have a chat before meeting
* can have a chat after meeting
* can leave from a meeting

* If a person is connected through a mobile phone, if they go to a new room and come back, their video freezes
